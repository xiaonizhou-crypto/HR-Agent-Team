# HR Agent Team

![HR Agent Team cover](assets/repo-cover.svg)

A minimal OpenClaw skill prototype for a small HR Agent Team workflow.

This repo now captures that loop in an OpenClaw skill-friendly structure:

- Resume Screener
- Candidate Coordinator
- Hiring Ops Tracker
- Feishu table update

It is **not** a full ATS, HRMS, or recruiting platform.
It is a lightweight prototype for a real, already-tested hiring loop.

## What is already working

### 1) Resume Screener
Handles first-pass screening for incoming resumes.

### 2) Candidate Coordinator
Handles only 3 actions:
- request-more-info message
- interview scheduling message
- candidate reply summary

### 3) Hiring Ops Tracker
Handles only 4 actions:
- current stage
- current owner
- next step
- blocked / timeout status

## Current workflow

Resume in  
→ Resume Screener  
→ Candidate Coordinator  
→ Hiring Ops Tracker  
→ Feishu update

## Fixed rules in this prototype

### Stage fields
- 待补资料
- 待约初面
- 待面试反馈
- 待继续推进
- 待归档
- 已暂停
- 已转岗

### Status fields
- 正常推进
- 临近超时
- 已卡住

### Time rules
- within 24 hours → 正常推进
- 24–48 hours → 临近超时
- over 48 hours → 已卡住
